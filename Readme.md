* [DashboardViewer.GetItemDataAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.GetItemDataAsync(System.String)) method. Gets data displayed within a dashboard item, asynchronously.
* [DashboardViewer.Initialized](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.Initialized) event. Handle this event to perform asynchronous tasks on the first load.
